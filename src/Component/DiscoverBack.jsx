                The Baccarat Hotel & Residences New York's aesthetic is sumptuous: the hotel glistens with crystal at every corner in the lobby,
                 a dazzling light installation of Baccarat Harcourt glasses and throughout the hotel mood lighting, herringbone wood flooring,
                 and rich, lavish fabrics, courtesy of design duo Gilles & Boissier. Lest you think that youâ€™ve somehow crossed the Atlantic, 
                the hotel is located smack-dab in Midtown, across the MoMA, and a stroll away from the Rockefeller Centre
